# Hooks

## Overview

Uniswap V4 introduces a powerful and flexible hook system that allows developers to customize and extend the behavior of liquidity pools. Hooks are external smart contracts that can be attached to individual pools to intercept and modify the execution flow at specific points during pool-related actions.

## Key Concepts

### Pool-Specific Hooks

- Each liquidity pool in Uniswap V4 has its own hook contract attached to it.
- The hook contract is specified when creating a new pool in the `PoolManager.initialize` function.
- Having pool-specific hooks allows for fine-grained control and customization of individual pools.

### Hook Functions

- Hooks provide a set of predefined functions that can be implemented by developers to customize pool behavior.
- These functions are called by the `PoolManager` at specific stages during the execution of pool-related actions.
- Developers can implement custom logic, perform additional checks, or modify parameters within these hook functions.

### Hook Permissions

- Hook contracts specify the permissions that determine which hook functions they implement.
- Permissions are defined using the `Hooks.Permissions` struct, where each permission corresponds to a specific hook function.
- The `PoolManager` uses these permissions to determine which hook functions to call for a given pool.

## Core Hook Functions

Uniswap V4 provides a set of core hook functions that can be implemented by developers:

### Initialize Hooks

- `beforeInitialize`: Called before a new pool is initialized.
- `afterInitialize`: Called after a new pool is initialized.
- These hooks allow developers to perform custom actions or validations during pool initialization.

### Liquidity Modification Hooks

- `beforeAddLiquidity`: Called before liquidity is added to a pool.
- `afterAddLiquidity`: Called after liquidity is added to a pool.
- `beforeRemoveLiquidity`: Called before liquidity is removed from a pool.
- `afterRemoveLiquidity`: Called after liquidity is removed from a pool.
- These hooks enable customization of liquidity management, such as [insert examples]

### Swap Hooks

- `beforeSwap`: Called before a swap is executed in a pool.
- `afterSwap`: Called after a swap is executed in a pool.
- Swap hooks allow developers to modify swap behavior, applying fees, [insert examples]

### Donate Hooks

- `beforeDonate`: Called before a donation is made to a pool.
- `afterDonate`: Called after a donation is made to a pool.
- Donate hooks provide a way to customize the behavior of token donations to liquidity providers.

## Innovation and Potential

The introduction of hooks in Uniswap V4 opens up a world of possibilities for developers to innovate and build new DeFi protocols. Some potential use cases include:

- Customized AMMs with different pricing curves that xy = k.
- Yield farming and liquidity mining protocols that incentivize liquidity provision.
- Derivative and synthetic asset platforms built on top of Uniswap V4 liquidity.
- Lending hooks integrated with Uniswap V4 pools.


As a hook developer you can easily bootstrap the codebase of an entirely new DeFi protocol through hook designs, which subsequently drives down your audit costs and allows you to develop faster. However, its important to note that just because you made a hook, that does not mean you will get liquidity routed to your hook from the Uniswap frontend.
